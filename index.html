    <h1>Anna Tsvetkov</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a Philosophy PhD and Computer Science Sc.M student at Brown. I am also a researcher at MIT FutureTech Lab.</p>
    <p>I work with Adam Pautz, Ellie Pavlick, Chris Hill, and David Chalmers (NYU).</p>
    <p>My research aims to develop a human-centered approach to AI which integrates philosophical inquiry about the mind with cutting-edge methods in computer science.</p>
    <p>The aspiration of my research is that philosophy can guide carefully designed experiments on AI that deepen our understanding of the mind and, in turn, insights about the mind can help us build explainable and ethical AI. </p>
